The first is to                      identify basic concepts (such as Newton's Laws), that instructors                      believe are well understood by students, but which are                      not.&nbsp; </font></p>              <p align="left" class="style17">Here the point is to grab the instructor's                  attention, so that they think more critically about their own                  summative assessments (i.e. tests) and begin to rethink what                  they &quot;cover&quot; and how they assess their effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The                  role of the FCI in this type of instructional transformation                  has been described in detail by a number of prominent instructors                  in physics and has lead to a number of alternative teaching                  strategies, such as Eric Mazur's <a href="http://mazur-www.harvard.edu/education/educationmenu.php" target="_blank"><strong>peer                  instruction</strong></a> and Bob Beichner's <a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/ncsu/pams/physics/Physics_Ed/scaleup.html" target="_blank"><strong>scale-up</strong></a> project.                  &nbsp; In these classes lecture time is dramatically reduced,                  and students spend more time in various forms of interactive                  engagement with the materials. </p>              <p align="left" class="style17">The immediate goal of the                  BCI is to catalyze a similar transformation in the biological                  education.&nbsp; </p>              <p align="left" class="style17"><font color="#000000">The second                      goal of concept inventories and related  instruments                      is to identify student misconceptions, either innate or                      introduced in the course of instruction, in order to determine                      what approaches are most effective at leading students                      to  conceptual mastery.&nbsp;

this                      is especially true at the post-secondary level because                      we are faced with large class sizes and increasing pressure                      to demonstrate that we can not only bring in research dollars,                      but can teach students effectively in this type of learning                      environment as well. In an ideal world, we would be able                      to spend a considerable amount of time speaking to each                      of our students so that we could accurately gage their                      level of conceptual understanding. Conceptual understanding                      is particularly important with regard to the fundamental                      principles in a given discipline. With it, students can                      synthesize what they are learning to solve new problems                      and (eventually) move the discipline in different and unique                      directions. Without conceptual understanding, students                      are limited to the ability to define, label, categorize,                      etc.&nbsp; </span></p>              <p class="style17">When we are fortunate and have considerable                  help in the form of graduate students, we might be able to                  give an essay exam to students in a course with 400 of them                  as a means of finding out how deep their conceptual understanding                  goes, but by the time we are able to collect their essays and                  evaluate or assess them, it is often too late to address areas                  where they have the most difficulty. Hence concept inventories.                  Concept inventories are instruments that look like standard                  multiple-choice examinations, but are much more.&nbsp; There                  are many types of conceptual understanding such as, preconceived                  notions, non-scientific beliefs, conceptual misunderstandings,                  vernacular misconceptions, and factual misconceptions (e.g.,                  Bio 2010). That is a great deal of territory to cover and,                  thus far, widely-used concept inventories tend to be limited                  to identifying only some types of misconceptions as well as                  only some portion of the material covered in any given course.&nbsp;&nbsp; In                  the case of the Biology Concept Inventory we are developing,                  we have elected to focus on conceptual misconceptions, preconceived                  notions, and vernacular misconceptions.</p>              <p class="style17">The instruments that function as a concept inventory                  employ a multiple choice format where each distracter indicates                  a commonly held misconception that has been rigorously documented                  by research. In this way, each potential response indicates                  something about the student&rsquo;s thinking and their difficulties                  in ways that allow teachers to directly address them in their                  teaching. These instruments are often controversial within                  a given community as well, because they rely on natural language                  rather than on the usual vocabulary and jargon employed in                  the discipline. By the time students arrive in our classrooms,                  they have already internalized the rhetoric of science. For                  example, when faced with broad, open-ended questions asking                  them to use their own words to explain something like diffusion,                  students always fell back on what they have learned is expected                  of them when responding to essay questions in science &ndash; they                  defined, they labeled, they employed rote memorization.&nbsp; On                  top of that, they were not used to essay questions that were                  open and had no single &ldquo;right&rdquo; response, so they                  often failed entirely to even address the question asked.&nbsp; It                  is because of the predominant use of the rhetoric of science                  among our STEM students that we have to force them outside                  the box by using the wording they use when they talk to a non-expert                  about biology (or whatever subject you are interested in).                  It is no small thing to discover a means of wording both questions                  and potential responses in ways that force students to reveal                  what they really understand &ndash; and more importantly, what                  they think they understand, but do not (see e.g., A Private                  Universe).&nbsp; This is precisely why concept inventories                  are so important, but also so time-consuming and difficult                  to build.&nbsp; You have to get inside students&rsquo; heads                  in ways that allow them to really explain their understanding                  in their own words; then you have to find a way to translate                  the patterns among the wide variety of ways that students express                  the same thinking so that you can develop pilot questions;                  and finally, you have to validate each question as well as                  each distracter and correct response to ensure that when students                  read the question, they &ldquo;see&rdquo; the same question                  you intended, and when they select a response that it accurately                  reflects their level of conceptual understanding.</p>              <p class="style17">Why go to all of this trouble? There are many                  reasons, but there are two primary uses for concept inventories:                  1) they provide a standardized measure that has been developed,                  validated, and tested for its reliability using solid research                  methods based on epistemological theories that form the foundation                  of what we know and understand about learning; and 2) the instrument                  is administered pre- and post-instruction and the standardization                  enables professors to determine the degree to which their particular                  teaching approach enabled their students to overcome their                  earlier misconceptions (e.g., Mazur).&nbsp; These characteristics                  also allow for comparison of teaching approaches on a given                  concept or concept cluster across courses, institutions, etc.                  (e.g., Hake&rsquo;s meta-study on interactive engagement using                  the FCI as the standard).</p>              <p class="style17">So, concept inventories are difficult to build                  because they require a large body of detailed quantitative                  and qualitative research. When common misconceptions have been                  documented in a given discipline, building questions is much                  easier, but in our case (and that of most STEM disciplines),                  there is very little quality research that reliably documents                  common areas of misconceptions as well as what those misconceptions                  indicate. As a result, we followed the methodology and development                  process utilized for the development of the Force Concept Inventory                  (FCI; Halloun &amp; Hesteness) with the addition of the use                  of initial essay questions as per the development of the Astronomy            Diagnostic Test (ADT; Zeilik, et al). </p></td>      </tr>  </table>  <table width="660" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>          <td><div align="right"><font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">next              &ndash; <a href="/design.html" target="_self">building the BCI</a></font>                  <hr size="1">                  <font color="#000000" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  </font></div></td>      </tr>  </table>    <table width="660" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>          <td><font color="#006600" size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">bio</font><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000"><b>literacy</b></font><font color="#FF3333">.</font></font><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">net </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#000000" size="-2"> &copy; </font><font color="#000000" size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">all                      rights reserved</font></font></td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td><div align="right"><font color="#000000" size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">last                      update 29 October 2006 </font></div></td>      </tr>  </table></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
